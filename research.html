    <!-- SUMMARY -->
    <p class="lede">
      My research focuses on ways in which institutional policy and our perspectives can lower barriers experienced by minoritized students in higher education systems.
      Across projects, I examine how students navigate identity, racism, and access to resources, and how institutions can design more culturally sustaining and information-accessible environments.

            I study how institutional rules, communication practices, and resource distribution shape students’ experiences of inclusion. I am especially interested in how
            institutions can lower barriers that disproportionately impact minoritized students.

          <p class="small" style="margin: 10px 0 0;">
            This project examines whether access to comfort food or familiar food is related to a sense of belonging among Korean American students. I focus on how culturally
            meaningful food experiences are shaped by institutional environments and how they may function as a form of care, recognition, or exclusion.

          <p class="small" style="margin: 10px 0 0;">
            This project analyzed how California K–12 school district websites communicate interpretation and translation services. I examined the availability and accessibility
            of language-access information, with attention to how institutional communication practices can either lower or reinforce barriers for immigrant-origin families.

          <p class="small" style="margin: 10px 0 0;">
            My master’s thesis examined how Korean American students identify themselves and how different immigrant generations experience and interpret racism. I was especially
            interested in the forms of racism students described during the COVID period and how these experiences shaped identity and belonging.

            This line of inquiry focuses on how AI tools might support students in understanding and navigating institutional information, particularly where policies and procedures
            are complex, fragmented, or difficult to access. I am interested in equity-centered design and implementation that prioritizes transparency, student agency, and responsible use.

      <div class="item">
        <p class="small" style="margin: 0;">
          I primarily use qualitative and policy-relevant approaches, including interview-based inquiry, document and website analysis, and interpretive analysis focused on how students
          experience institutional environments. My work is oriented toward practical implications: how institutions can redesign policies, communications, and campus practices to reduce barriers
          and cultivate belonging.
