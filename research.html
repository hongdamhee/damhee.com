    <p class="lede">
      My research interests are grounded in the belief that when students are encouraged to bring their whole selves into educational environments and feel that their cultural, linguistic, and personal identities are valued, they are more likely to experience belonging and to thrive academically and personally. My research projects therefore center on exploring how institutional and systemic barriers can be lowered so students can thrive while bringing their full identities into school spaces. Across my projects, I focus on how students from minoritized backgrounds can be supported in ways that recognize and affirm the diverse knowledge, strengths, and lived experiences they bring with them. My work centers Korean American and immigrant-origin communities and uses qualitative inquiry to understand identity, belonging, and access.
